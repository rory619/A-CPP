Welcome to my AStar Algorithm C++ blog!




**week 1**
Researching the project, finding out the requirements and researching the A* algorithm

**week 2**
Sorting out file structure and creating the files I think I will need to get the algorithm working


**week 3**
Researching the purpose for each file and ensuring I understand what data each file should have 


**week 4**
Cereated a smoke test that ensures my files are building correctly and the control flow works as intended and the core matrix lifecycle works

**week 5**
populated other files with data that allows matrix output capability and prints out a grid
