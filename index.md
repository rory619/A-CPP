Welcome to my AStar Algorithm C++ blog!




**week 1**
Researching the project, finding out the requirements and researching the A* algorithm

**week 2**
Sorting out file structure and creating the files I think I will need to get the algorithm working


**week 3**
Researching the purpose for each file and ensuring I understand what data each file should have 


**week 4**
Cereated a smoke test that ensures my files are building correctly and the control flow works as intended and the core matrix lifecycle works

**week 5**
populated other files with data that allows matrix output capability and prints out a grid


**week 6**
Pushed nost recent progress to github that creates a 5x5 grid and prints it to the console
Grid.h: holds cells_ using a vector
Point.h: Defines the point coordinate type for grid positions
Heuristic.h: Uses the Manhattan distance formula for movement up, down, left, right
AStarSolver.h: declares find path function, but I am not using it yet
Main.cpp: brings the program together and runs it as a smoke test and doesnt run any A* logic yet
Grid.cpp: Implements grid methods from Grid.h
AStar.cpp: will have the A* logic but hasnt been implemented but has not been implemented at this time


**week 7**
